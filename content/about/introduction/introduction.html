      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        This introduction to the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) explains the purpose of the APG, who it intends to serve, and how it is organized.
      </p>
      <section id="purpose">
        <h2>Purpose of the APG</h2>
        <p>
          The APG explains how to develop web experiences for people who rely on assistive technologies and keyboard interfaces.
          It includes a library of accessible user interface patterns with example implementations that explain how to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make common user interface patterns accessible by using features of the
            <a class="specref" href="#abstract">Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) specification</a>
            in combination with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use ARIA, HTML, and CSS to implement fundamental accessibility practices, such as providing accessible names, enabling keyboard interaction, conveying page structure to assistive technologies, and supporting high contrast operating system settings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The primary aim of the APG is to explain and illustrate appropriate use of ARIA attributes and related HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques for supporting accessibility.
          It strives to build broad understanding  and adoption of accessibility practices that are consistent with ARIA specifications and thus promote greater availability of robust accessible experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the APG includes a library of patterns and functional examples, it's objectives do not include providing a   comprehensive design system or production-ready code.
          Rather, the examples, including  code style, are designed to facilitate learning the accessibility concepts they illustrate.
          While the examples are intended to be reasonably realistic and utilize modern coding techniques, their purpose is not to teach other dimensions of web engineering.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="audience">
        <h2>Who It's For and What  You Need to Know First</h2>
        <p>
          While some parts of APG content assumes some understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is intended to serve a broad audience of people who work to ensure web content is accessible. It may be particularly useful to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designers and engineers who are working on site design systems and component libraries.</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is important to understand that the APG only covers a portion of what is needed to create accessible experiences.
          To understand accessibility more broadly, it is advisable to start with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/">WAI Accessibility Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/design-develop/">WAI Overview of Design and Development</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="organization">
        <h2>How  the APG is Organized</h2>
        <p>
          The APG is organized into two major sections: patterns and practices.
          Each pattern explains how to make a common user interface element, such as a button, menu, or dialog, accessible, and provides functional example implementations of the pattern.
          The practices section gives in-depth explanation of how to satisfy a variety of accessibility needs that surface when making rich internet application experiences accessible.
          For instance, the practices section on providing accessible names and descriptions gives detailed descriptions of seven different naming techniques as well as a table providing guidance for naming more than 80 types of elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APG describes accessibility semantics and keyboard interaction for many common user interface patterns, ranging from typical buttons and popup menus to complex tree grids.
          The patterns are illustrated by functional example code and linked to explanations of fundamental accessibility practices they incorporate.
          Practices cover topics such as how to effectively utilize the many ways of encoding accessible names and convey web page structure with ARIA landmark regions.
