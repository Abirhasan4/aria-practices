          <p>
            The APG synthesizes guidance based on information from several specifications.
            While the guidance contains contextual links to relevant specifications, it can be handy to have
            <a href="related-specifications/related-specifications.html">Related Specifications</a>
            together in a single list.

          <p>
            Objectives of the APG Task Force include providing guidance or examples for all ARIA attributes and doing so with code that implements practices documented in the APG code guide.
            Progress toward these objectives is tracked by the
            <a href="coverage-and-quality/coverage-and-quality-report.html">Coverage and Quality Reports</a>
            that are automatically regenerated as the APG is revised.
