      This document provides readers with an understanding of how to use <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 1.2</a></cite> [[WAI-ARIA]] to create accessible rich internet applications.
      It describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties.
      This document is directed primarily to Web application developers, but the guidance is also useful for user agent and assistive technology developers.
    </p>
    <p>This document is part of the WAI-ARIA suite described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA Overview</a>.</p>

      This is an editor's draft by the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group</a>
      of the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>.
      It supports the
      [[[wai-aria-1.2]]] [[WAI-ARIA-1.2]]
      specification, providing detailed advice and examples beyond what would be appropriate to a technical specification but which are important to understand the specification.
    </p>
